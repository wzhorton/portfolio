Kalman filters are a method of reducing noise in time series data. In this paper we seek to reduce the noise captured in starlight measurements to identify distant planets. We also propose a heuristic improvement to the algorithm to account for another source of variation.

This project showcases both comprehension of a cross-disciplinary method and innovation in the face of difficulty.
