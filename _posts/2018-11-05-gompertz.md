The Gompertz distribution has historically been used to model adult mortality. Although the approximation is not great, the Gompertz has properties consistent with mortality rates that make it a desirable baseline for modeling. This project explores fundamental properties of this relatively unknown distribution and demonstrates how it might be used. 

This project was the first academic paper I wrote in my M.S. program. It represents an imperfect and somewhat incomplete yet extensive treatment of an unfamiliar topic.
