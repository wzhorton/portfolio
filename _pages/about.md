My name is Zach and I am a current Master's student applying to Ph.D. programs in Statistics.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Here you will find a selection of projects and presentations I have created during my time as a Statistics M.S. student. They demonstrate my abilities as both a writer and a statistician.
